## About Remark Lint

[Remark Lint](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-lint) is a [remark](https://remark.js.org/) plugin to lint Markdown code style.

Brief documentation for Remark Lint is available on [the project's website](https://remark.js.org/). More detailed information is available at [Remark Lint's GitHub repo](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark/blob/master/packages/remark-lint/readme.md#remark-lint).  Any issues with Remark Lint should be lodged on the [project's issue page](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark/issues).

## About the package

As with packages hosted on the [Arch User Repository](https://aur.archlinux.org/) bear in mind that this is an unofficial package.  An understanding of [makepkg](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Makepkg) and [pacman](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Pacman) is required for the build and installation process.  The [Arch Linux Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/) article about the [Arch User Repository](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_User_Repository) should also be read.

As part of the testing process the PKGBUILD and the compiled package have been scanned by [Namcap](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Namcap).  Sources have also been checked by [ClamAV](https://www.clamav.net/).
